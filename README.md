MScFinalProject
===============
This repository contains all of the source code for my final project at Kingston University. The projects' aim is to implement shadow rendering in a 2D game using a 3D environment. The method implemented heavily relies on CPU calculations of lights projecting onto surfaces and mapping a given sprite using the projections to render a translucent version onto the surface.

This method is not highly scalable and more of a proof of concept. The application may not run of certain systems due to push constant size restrictions.
